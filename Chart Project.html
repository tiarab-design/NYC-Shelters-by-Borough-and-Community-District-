		<p> Comptroller NYC Gov <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/review-of-the-new-york-city-department-of-homeless-services-programs-and-services//">reported</a> that the DHS system includes a wide variety of shelter types. The most popular are traditional shelters for single people, which provide shared or dorm-style accommodations and on-site social services, and commercial hotels, which offer rooms and serve the public simultaneously. With varying resources and services, each type of shelter caters to a distinct clientele.


Families with children are usually housed in separate apartments with private restrooms, and many Tier II shelters provide kitchenettes within their units. Adult families may be assigned to a shelter with communal restrooms or a unit like those provided to families with children. The majority of single adult shelters are congregate shelters where residents share food, sleeping, and restroom facilities.

		<p>Loretta Robison, an HRA worker at DHS, explains the reason why some districts in the Bronx and Brooklyn have more adult shelters compared to other boroughs. “The Bronx and Brooklyn have more homeless shelters than other boroughs in New York City due to higher poverty, unemployment, and low-income populations,” said Robison.
